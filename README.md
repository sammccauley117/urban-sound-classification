# Urban Sound Classification
This repository is for my first Kaggle challenge. The link to the original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/papeloto/urban-sound-feature-extraction-knn). The dataset has more than 8000 classified sound-bites or urban sounds. There are 10 different classifications:

1. Air conditioner
1. Car horn
1. Children playing
1. Dog bark
1. Drilling
1. Engine idling
1. Gun shot
1. Jackhammer
1. Siren
1. Street music

My goal is to use signal processing and machine learning techniques to create a model that can accurately classify these sounds.
